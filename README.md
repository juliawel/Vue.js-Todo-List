Todo List App

A simple Todo List application built with Vue.js. 
This app allows users to create, categorize, and manage their tasks, 
  with data persistence using localStorage.

--Features--

Add tasks: Users can add new tasks with a category selection;
Edit tasks: Modify task content directly from the list;
Delete tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed;
Mark tasks as done: Checkbox to mark tasks as completed;
Category filtering: Tasks can be categorized as 'business' or 'personal';
LocalStorage persistence: Saves the tasks and user name in the browser,
  so they persist even after the page is refreshed;

--Technologies--

Vue 3;
JavaScript;
HTML/CSS;
LocalStorage for data persistence;

Form handling: Worked with form inputs, v-model bindings, and how to submit forms using Vue's event modifiers;
LocalStorage persistence: Implemented persistent data storage using localStorage for tasks and user data;
